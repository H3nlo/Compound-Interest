# Compound Interest
 Compound Interest Calculator
The problem that my code solves is - It gives an easy option to calculate compound interest. It has the options to enter the amount you want to invest, the interest rate, and if you want return monthly, quarterly or yearly.
I defined the problem and evaluated it. I then found different ways of calculating the interest (more fficient for the coding part), I chose the most efficient and implemented that into the code. I then tested it and evaluated the code.
